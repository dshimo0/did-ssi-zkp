# Decentralized Identity (DID) & Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) / ZKP

This repository gathers **resources, tools, papers, and project links** related to the development, implementation, and exploration of **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** and **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**.

Ideal for developers, IAM architects, Web3 builders, researchers, and digital identity enthusiasts.

## What Are DID and SSI?

- **DID (Decentralized Identifier):** A globally unique identifier that enables verifiable, self-controlled digital identities without relying on centralized authorities.
- **SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity):** A model in which individuals own, control, and share their digital credentials with full autonomy.

## What Is ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof)?

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** are cryptographic methods that allow one party (the prover) to prove to another (the verifier) that they know a value or fulfill a condition **without revealing any of the underlying data**.

**Use cases in identity:**
- Prove you're over 18 without revealing your birthdate.
- Prove you have a valid diploma without exposing the full certificate.
- Enhance privacy and trust in verifiable credentials.

## National Proposals / Experiments (Brazil)

- **bCPF / bCNPJ:** Initiatives under discussion and prototyping using blockchain to anchor Brazilian national identifiers (CPF/CNPJ) as DIDs, especially explored by Serpro and government agencies in contexts of interoperability and credential verification.
- **CPQD (Brazil):** Developing identity-focused frameworks and research in SSI/DID.

## Use Cases
- Employee onboarding with verified credentials
- Academic diplomas and certifications
- COVID-19 vaccination credentials
- Digital identity for stateless populations/refugees
- Passwordless login and verifiable proof of attributes
